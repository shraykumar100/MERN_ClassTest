    </h4>
    Doctor Stephen Strange is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics.
    Created by Steve Ditko with Stan Lee,[5] the character first appeared in Strange Tales #110 (cover-dated July 1963).
    Doctor Strange serves as the Sorcerer Supreme, the primary protector of Earth against magical and mystical threats.
    Strange was created during the Silver Age of Comic Books to bring a different kind of character and themes of
    mysticism to Marvel Comics.

    The character begins as an extremely talented but egotistical surgeon who loses the ability to operate after a car
    crash severely damages his hands beyond repair. Searching the globe for healing, he encounters the Ancient One, the
    Sorcerer Supreme. Strange becomes his student, and learns to be a master of both the mystical and the martial arts.
    He acquires an assortment of mystical objects, including the powerful Eye of Agamotto and Cloak of Levitation, and
    takes up residence in a mansion referred to as the Sanctum Sanctorum, located in 177A Bleecker Street, Greenwich
    Village, New York City. Strange assumes the title of Sorcerer Supreme and, with his friend and valet Wong, defends
    the world from mystical threats.

    The character was first portrayed in live-action by Peter Hooten in the 1978 television film Dr. Strange. Benedict
    Cumberbatch portrays Stephen Strange in the Marvel Cinematic Universe films Doctor Strange (2016), Thor: Ragnarok
    (2017), Avengers: Infinity War (2018), Avengers: Endgame (2019), and Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021). Cumberbatch
    also voices an alternate universe version in the Disney+ animated series What If...? (2021) and will reprise his
    role in the upcoming film Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (2022).
